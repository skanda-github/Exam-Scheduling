Simple website using NodeJS and MySQL which is used to allot rooms for students, teachers for invigilation and time table creation.

In this work, an examination management system, a web-based application test administration software, is suggested to manage various online examination settings. The proposed system stands out for its excellent architecture designs, user-friendliness, wealth of features, flexibility, and extensibility. This project can be used to assign students to rooms and assign exam rooms. By entering the students' USN, we may even see their schedule.
